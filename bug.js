While working on an Expo project, I encountered an unusual error related to the Expo CLI.  Specifically, when attempting to run `expo start` after making seemingly minor changes to my project's code, the development server would fail to start, producing cryptic error messages or simply hanging indefinitely. The error messages varied, offering no clear indication of the root cause. This problem was particularly frustrating as similar changes previously caused no issues, and simple `expo start --reset` commands often didn't resolve the problem.
