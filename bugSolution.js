The solution to the intermittent Expo CLI failure involved a combination of techniques to ensure a clean project environment and the proper handling of dependencies. First, we thoroughly cleaned the project's cache by running `expo prebuild --clean` and `expo start --reset` multiple times.  Second, the package.json file was carefully checked to identify and resolve any potentially conflicting dependencies or version inconsistencies.  In some cases, reinstalling the entire node modules using `npm install --force` or `yarn install --force` proved necessary. Finally, after making the code changes, restarting the computer proved successful. This strongly suggests the problem is associated with cached data and dependency management within the node_modules folder.
